# Andrew Baca

<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew Baca, a passionate lead software developer at Electronic Caregiver with a knack for crafting seamless digital experiences. Armed with a degree in computer science from New Mexico State University, my journey began as an Electrical Engineering major until a C programming class ignited my love for Computer Science. I've navigated diverse tech landscapes, from revamping legacy systems in React at Electronic Caregiver to full-stack development at Steele Consulting, where I delved into Angular, .NET, and even ventured into iOS applications for airport parking solutions. In 2024, I returned to Electronic Caregiver, steering the Microservices team to new heights with a focus on AWS services and API wizardry. Beyond the keyboard, you'll find me immersed in board games, conquering video game realms, and cherishing moments with my beloved mini schnauzer, Ziggy. ðŸ”§ðŸ’» #CodeLife #AWSMaestro ðŸš€
